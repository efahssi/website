Cotton Nero A.x. is a 14th century manuscript in the British Library. 

## 🔎 Overview
It is the only existing copy of four important Middle English poems: [Sir Gawain and the Green Knight](https://wpsites.ucalgary.ca/gawain-ms/wp-content/uploads/sites/146/2024/01/SGGK-final.pdf), [Pearl](https://wpsites.ucalgary.ca/gawain-ms/wp-content/uploads/sites/146/2024/01/Pearl-peer-reviewed.pdf), [Patience](https://wpsites.ucalgary.ca/gawain-ms/wp-content/uploads/sites/146/2024/01/Patience-final-.pdf), and [Cleanness](https://wpsites.ucalgary.ca/gawain-ms/wp-content/uploads/sites/146/2024/01/Cleanness-critical-ed-final.pdf). The Project captured high-quality digital photographs of the entire manuscript; transcribed the entire manuscript at the highest possible level of accuracy and detail; and published critical editions of each of the individual poems. We used XML to describe manuscript features, and provided descriptions of the script and writing.

## 📋 Objectives

- Publish high-quality digital photographs of the entire manuscript to facilitate future research and public access.
- Transcribe the entire manuscript at the highest possible level of accuracy and detail.
- Pproduce editions of each of the individual poems in which the digital facsimiles and the new transcriptions serve as a basis for a new critical text with glossary, full-textual and explanatory notes, and other supports for readers.
- Develop markup schema using XML and XSLT to render manuscript features on-screen.
